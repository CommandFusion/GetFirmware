 *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*
 * 2.5.1b    28/03/2017  Minor fix on interlock to close all relay ports at once
 *                       when interlock group is not assigned or disabled.    
 * 2.5.0b    27/03/2017  1. Minor rework to fix relay ports not closing all at once when
 *                       relay interlocking is not assigned. 
 *                       2. Enable Math expressions with variable referencing for SPW (Serial Port Write).
 *                       Expressions must be defined within double curly braces open and close characters.
 * 2.4.0b    21/03/2017  Add CFLink Command for Relay Interlocking:
 *                       a) CRLYILC - configure interlock group.
 *                       b) QRLYILC - query interlock group. 
 *                       c) CRLYILD - delete interlock group. 
 *                       Refer to cflink protocol's document for more details.   
 * 2.3.0b    14/03/2017  Rework for verbose mode. Enable individual bit setting for reporting.   
 *                       0 = simple reporting.
 *                       1 = complete reporting. 
 * 2.2.2b    01/03/2017  Set optimization level = 0 for spi eeprom library.  
 * 2.2.1b    01/03/2017  Minor fixes for verbose mode.  
 * 2.2.0b    01/03/2017  Enable verbose mode (CCFXVRB/QCFXVRB)for simple or complete status reporting. 
 *                       1 = simple reporting.
 *                       2 = complete reporting.
 * 2.1.2b    20/02/2017  CHA event will not sent until a change in dry contact state actually happens, 
 *                       ie. the state it is in on power-up is not a change. Only send if changed after first reading.
 * 2.1.1b    02/01/2016  1. Minor fixes on usb transmit buffer overflows problem. The system will now wait 
 *                       for the write operation to complete before sending the next bytes to 
 *                       prevent packet loss during transmission. 
 *                       2. Enable WHO reporting during device startup. 
 * 2.1.0b    14/12/2016  Enable command(CCFXDCP) to configure the dry contact ports. Each port 
 *                       is able to be configured as NORMAL (default) or ADVANCE mode.
 *                       In ADVANCE mode, the generation of CHA notification will base on the double-tap-time
 *                       and hold-time.  
 * 2.0.0b    30/11/2016  Enable command to configure the communication properties for each control port.
 *                       Each port is able to be configured as BUS or EXT (third party control).  
 * 1.3.0     30/09/2016  Enable factory reset function by pressing and holding SETUP button
 *                       on device boot-up.     
 * 1.2.1     26/09/2016  Stop error reporting if the targetted broadcast command is not recognized. 
 * 1.2.0     13/09/2016  Split firmware version for DIN-RY5 and DIN-RY5-N. 
 * 1.1.1     16/06/2016  Minor fixes in CVARSET return message.
 * 1.1.0     07/06/2016  Some enhancements in RS232/RS485 communication buffering:
 *                       1. Increase receive buffer size from 2000 bytes to 4000 bytes.
 *                       2. Increase transmit buffer size from 1000 bytes to 4000 bytes.
 *                       3. Add a safety timer to monitor message out of synch problem.
 *                          This will prevent corrupted cflink packets from hogging the receiving buffer.  
 *                       Some fixes on the firmware:
 *                       1. Firmware replies wrong error message during firmware update.
 *                       2. Unexpected fail events in firmware update. Update to 1.1.0 will fix the problem.
 *                       3. Expression parser failed to read port number correctly.    
 *                       Notes:
 *                       1. It is compulsory to use USB interface to upload the v1.1.0 firmware. Future's firmware upload
 *                          can be done through USB or RS232.    
 * 1.0.1     21/05/2016  Some improvements on message handling to allow actions triggered by rules
 *                       able to reach all the devices within the same network.
 * 1.0.0     13/05/2016  DIN-RY5 firmware first release.
