 *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*
 * 1.6.6     22/11/2016   Bug fixes: 
 *						  1. Reboot the device when BOOT Flag is set to 1 in TCFXANN. 
 * 1.6.5     26/10/2016   IO fixes for mode R to limit the max resistance value to 25500 ohm.
 *                        This will make sure no garbled value is reported when the load is OPEN.
 * 1.6.4     24/10/2016   New features:
 *                        1) Enable HNM and HNR to enter a URL without http://
 *                        2) Enable conditional expressions in macro. 
 *                        3) Add support for inputLevel within conditional expressions. 
 *                           eg. inputLevel(1) == 123. This would check if the current level of input 1 
 *                           (either resistance or voltage) is equal to 123 (in 0-255 range). 
 * 1.6.3     21/10/2016   Bug fixes:
 *                        1) All replies generated by a macro event should report to websocket, tcp and udp port 10207. 
 *                        For example: When a variable is set via a macro (using CVARSET) it should report the RVARSET with the new value.
 * 1.6.2     21/10/2016   Bug fixes:
 *                        1) HTTP requests missing initial forward slash if there is a path in the URL.

 * 1.4.0     04/10/2016   Enable port naming functions.
 *                        Added Cloud integration query - QCFXHNM and QCFXHNR.  
 * 1.3.0     28/09/2016   Added features:      
 *                        1) Add a warning if the web socket is still connected. Only single webserver connection is allowed.
 *                        2) Set the cache-control to no-cache when serving the HTTP headers.
 *                        3) Enable TCP Bridging for the 10 configurable ethernet slots. It allows up to 20 TCP Clients

 *                           pressing and holding the SETUP and RESET buttons simultaneously for 3 seconds.
 *                        3. Allows user to assign/read a name to/from a device using CCFXNME/QCFXNME command. The configured name is limited to
