CFMini
Version 1.3.1
1. Beta test first released.

Version 1.3.2 (14/2/2012)
1. Fixed:Factory reset power LED flashes differently on DIN-MOD4 and family products. Should be consistent
2. Fixed:Setup button on CF Mini should adjust RS232 port mode? Currently does not.

version 1.4.0
1. Added: optional IR Repeat Count parameter to end of MEM
2. Enables ir code to be transmitted using repeat count.

version 1.5.0
1. Added: CHA and STA reply for digital input
2. Added: CHA reply for IO8's dry contact mode.

version 1.6.0
1. Added: RULES ENABLED.

version 1.6.1
1. Change from TCFXIRW to CCFXIRW

version 1.6.2
1. Must initialized LAN_ID and SUB_ID before module initialization. 

version 1.6.2
1. Fixed: IO8 LED mode on state always starts with LED output on, even if configured to be off.

version 1.7.0
1. Added Common Eeprom version to keep EEPROM(Common) data valid through firmware updates. 
   version = 0x00000001
2. Added Device Eeprom version to keep EEPROM(Device specific) data valid through firmware updates.
   version = 0x00000001

version 1.7.1
1. Move RS232_Init() from DemoApp.c to CFMINI.c. (Release for production dated 19/3/2012)

version 1.7.2
1. Fixed IO saving bug (Release for production dated 23/3/2012)

version 1.7.3
1. Change CCFXRLS to CCFXRLW 
2. Change QCFXRLS to QCFXRLR		

version 1.7.4
1. Optimize .irx file format. Also add checksum to improve robustness

version 1.7.5
1. Lower down SPIEEPROM bus freq to 5Mhz for reliability.
2. Added CCFXRLD for rules delete

version 1.7.6
1. Added QCFXIRF for retrieving IR functions.
1. Added QCFXIRD for retrieving IR devices.

version 1.8.0
1. Added New Feature: Digital Voltage Input for IO reading.

version 1.9.0
1. Added New Feature: Video Sensing Input for IO reading.

version 1.10.0
1. Make reporting of IO error code more specific and descriptive. 

   CFIRX file format:
1. Redefinition of CFIR entry’s structure.
2. Change all ASCII hex data into binary.
3. 256 byte block is now transported as 512 bytes.
4. Support maximum of 128 CFIR entries.

version 1.10.1
1. Fixed IO reporting bug:
   R = Resistance reading input, <STATE> = 000-100 (0 to 10,000 Ohms in 100 Ohm increments)
   V = Voltage reading input   , <STATE> = 000-100 (00.0 to 10.0 Volts DC in 0.1 Volt increments)
2. Reducing the eeprom usage by storing min_change variable as byte per port.(previously as float).

version 1.10.2
1. Parsing hex bytes into \x for TMINSPW commands.
