 *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * 1.2.0    29/10/2014   Rework on the DS1338.c and CronScheduler.c for misfired scheduler's events problem.
 *                       Enable SOLO to report it's events to cloud based server www.commandfusion.com via HTTP POST
 *                       at interval of 15 seconds. The default URL would be “http://www.commandfusion.com/projects/hardware/log”.
 *                       Added RCFXRLT and RCFXSCT reporting for Schedule and Rules trigger events.
 * 1.1.5    22/10/2014   Rework on the websocket client. This fixes the problem where the reply messages from CFSOLO
 *                       not able to transmit out from the websocket.
 *                       Also, a minor bug in port naming was fixed which read from the wrong eeprom location.
 * 1.1.4    21/10/2014   Added websocket client to enable CFSolo remotely configurable.
 *                       CFSolo will first check for the connection flag set in HTTP response after making the announcement,
 *                       then it will attempt to connect to the server via web socket if the flag is 1.
 * 1.1.3    15/10/2014   Enables CFSolo to route data directly via TCP sockets to the on-board serial ports.
 *                       Each serial port would have a static TCP Server Port that it listens on, starting from 10208.
 *                       A maximum of 4 clients should be able to connect simultaneously to each socket.
 *                       Any data received by the serial port will be forwarded out to all TCP Clients connected.
 *                       Data is not transformed in any way, it is routed directly between the TCP socket and the Serial port, bi-directional.
 *                       This function is enabled by setting the <MODE> to "TCP" via CCFXSPC command.
 * 1.1.2    14/10/2014   Added the Query Macro Name List command QCFXMCL.
 *                       Added TCFXHTP command to enable CFSOLO to send custom HTTP GET requests
 *                       to any local or remote HTTP servers,
 * 1.1.1    13/10/2014   Fixed websocket connection close issue when the incoming bytes
 *                       exceeds maximum of 1000 bytes. Also enable TCP/UDP/HTTP server
 *                       to report error code.
 * 1.1.0    8/10/2014    Firmware support for CARD-CFLINK plugin card is enabled.
 * 1.0.12   24/9/2014    Added new command for port naming:
 *                       1. CCOMNAM - configure COM module port name
 *                       2. QCOMNAM - query COM modole port name
 *                       3. CIRXNAM - configure IR module port name
 *                       4. QIRXNAM - query IR module port name
 *                       5. CRLYNAM - configure relay module port name
 *                       6. QRLYNAM - query relay module port name
 * 1.0.11   22/9/2014    Resolve firmware QIRXSND bug.
 * 1.0.10   22/9/2014    Minor fix on reporting the dry contact states change. The reply
 *                       should be RSOLCHA instead of RSOLSTA.
 * 1.0.9    22/9/2014    Added features:
 *                       1. WHO message wil be sent out when the plugin card is changed (added or removed).
 *                       2. Remove all unwanted data in the UDP transmit buffer when the device hasn't obtain
 *                          a valid IP address.
 * 1.0.8    22/9/2014    1. The dry contact debounce period has been reduced to 100ms to
 *                          ensure any quick pulse below 100ms is read as undesired glitch
 *                          and it will be ignored.
 *                       2. Enable "TCFXSTP" (stop macro) command with no macro name to
 *                          stop all running macros.
 * 1.0.7    10/9/2014    Added support for both window and linux line ending CFX file.
 * 1.0.6    9/9/2014     Fixes on Websocket transmitter buffer.
 * 1.0.5    02/9/2014    Fixed Firmware crashes when STR IR data is invalid.
 *                       Rework on TCFXSPW.
 * 1.0.4    26/8/2014    Some minor fixes for CARD-LRY3.
 * 1.0.3    18/8/2014    Rename CFEventAndDelegates.c to CFTaskManager.
 *                       Some improvements on CFTaskManager and ModuleManager.c 
 *                       to enable hot swapping on external modules.
 *                       Added assert macro for firmware diagnostic.
 * 1.0.2    12/8/2014    Enable device factory reset by pressing SETUP and RESET on
 *                       device power up.
 * 1.0.1     8/8/2014    Added IR learning capability through onboard IR receiver.
