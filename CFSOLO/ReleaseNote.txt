 * 1.1.3    15/10/2014   Enables CFSolo to route data directly via TCP sockets to the on-board serial ports.
 *                       Each serial port would have a static TCP Server Port that it listens on, starting from 10208.
 *                       A maximum of 4 clients should be able to connect simultaneously to each socket.
 *                       Any data received by the serial port will be forwarded out to all TCP Clients connected.
 *                       Data is not transformed in any way, it is routed directly between the TCP socket and the Serial port, bi-directional.
 *                       This function is enabled by setting the <MODE> to "TCP" via CCFXSPC command.
