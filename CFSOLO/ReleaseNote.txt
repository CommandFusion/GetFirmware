 * Version   Date        Comment
 *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * 1.5.1    19/06/2015   Fixed IR Learner reporting issue.
 * 1.5.0    15/06/2015   Add 'Address Names'(0-63) and 'Group Names'(0-15) storage for each DALI channel.
 * 1.4.7    03/06/2015   Bug Fixes:
 *                       1) SOLO reporting error when the MAX TCP Bridging sockets is set to 10.  
 * 1.4.6    02/06/2015   Rework on the communication buffer handling for Ethernet Slot to improve on its data transfer
 *                       performance and robostness.   
 *                       Re-structure the error codes to stay inline with existing ones. 
 * 1.4.5    29/05/2015   Bug Fixes:
 *                       1) Wrong reporting data from IRLearner.
 *                       2) Limit the IRCode data reporting to USB and Websocket inteface only.  
 * 1.4.4    28/05/2015   Minor Changes:
 *                       1) Stop sending RSOLRCV logs to Control Center to ease the network traffic.
 *                       2) Report the log messages to Control Center every 15 secs or when the transmit buffer 
 *                          is 70% full, whichever comes first
 * 1.4.3    18/05/2015   Enable transmit/receive data fro TCP/HTTP server when DHCP is in config mode.
 *                       This is to make sure that the communication will happen when the SOLO is directly
 *                       connected to PC thru Ethernet cable without using external router/switcher.
 * 1.4.2    11/05/2015   Bug Fixes:
 *                       1) Change the TCP server bridge listening port for the five ethernet slots.
 *                          The TCP Servers would be setup on ports 10301 to 10305 (for slots 1-5).
 *                       2) Change default device name from 'DEFAULT_DEVICE_NAME' to 'Solo'
 * 1.4.1    08/05/2015   New Features:
 *                       1) Enable TCP Bridging for the 5 ethernet slots. It allows up to 10 TCP Clients
 *                          to connect to the Solo, and route data directly to/from any of the 5 communication slots.
 * 1.4.0    22/04/2015   New Features:
 *                       1) Report the memory usage for macros, schedules, rules, IR rules, and IR files
 *                          using QCFXMEM command. All usage is reported in bytes
 *                       2) Assign a name to a device using CCFXNME command. The configured name is limited to
 *                          50 bytes would also be sent as part of the WHO announcements and replies
 *                       3) Added connection status to the RCFXSLT and RCFXSPC string. It will should also
 *                          be sent any time the ethernet slot's connectivity changes (ie. when TCP Client connects or disconnects).
 *                       4) Add a debug mode to RS232 TCP ports (10208, 10209) to show TCP transmitted data to
 *                          dedicated serial port.The debug option can be enabled using CCFXSPC command.
 *                       Bug Fixes:
 *                       1) TCFXSPW fails when serial port is in TCP mode. Only works in 232 mode.
 *  	                 2) RS232 LED doesn't flash when transmitting serial data.
 * 1.3.3    02/04/2015   Set the default hostname to cc.commandfusion.com (from www.commandfusion.com)
 *                       Change the URL for cloud reporting to "/hardware/log".
 * 1.3.2    29/01/2015   Minor changes on ethernet slot functions:
 *                       1) Add validation to MacroName when configuring ethernet SLOT with CCFXSLT
 *			 2) When a SND command is sent and the specific slot is disabled, the system will reply with ERR message.	
 * 1.3.1    29/01/2015   Enable QCFXSLT to request all slot configs at once when no slot number specified.
 *                       The configuration for each slot is reported in separate replies.
 * 1.3.0    27/01/2015   Firmware support for CARD-DALI2 plugin card is now enabled.
 *                       CARD-DALI2 will act as DALI master which communicates with DALI slaves.
 *                       New commands:
 *                       1) TDALSND - transmit 2 bytes DALI packet to the DALI slaves.
 *                       2) RDALRCV - this is the response packet returned by the DALI slave.
 *                       3) QDALVER - query the firmware version of CARD-DALI2.
 * 1.2.6    21/01/2015   Enable private hostname setting for cloud reporting and device announce.
 *                       This is a factory option and not accessible by public.
 * 1.2.5    20/01/2015   1. Minor bug fixes on DAILY type scheduler where it fires the macro
 *                          about 5 times although no recurring is set in the firmware.
 *                       2. Redefine new format for serial number.
 *                          All the LAN based CF devices will be using MAC address AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
 *                          to generate its serial number using this format: AABBCCDDEEFF
 * 1.2.4    15/01/2015   Adding a few improvements on CARD-COM4 driver firmware.
 * 1.2.3    12/11/2014   Rework on IR Learner transmit buffer.

 *                       1) Optimizing for size (-Os)
 *                       2) Using -ffunction-sections and -fdata-sections.
 *                       3) Remove unused sections
 * 1.2.1    03/11/2014   Added ability for SOLO to communicate with other Ethernet devices, via 5 unique slot configurations (TCP and UDP).
 *                       New commands are added for this purpose:
 *                       1. CCFXSLT - to configure ethernet communication slots.
 *                       2. QCFXSLT - to query ethernet communication slot's setting.
 *                       3. TCFXSND - send data to slots.
 *                       4. RCFXRCV - data received from slots.

 *                       Enable SOLO to report it's events to cloud based server www.commandfusion.com via HTTP POST
 *                       at interval of 15 seconds. The default URL would be “http://www.commandfusion.com/projects/hardware/log”.
 *                       Added RCFXRLT and RCFXSCT reporting for Schedule and Rules trigger events.
 * 1.1.5    22/10/2014   Rework on the websocket client. This fixes the problem where the reply messages from CFSOLO
 *                       not able to transmit out from the websocket.
 *                       Also, a minor bug in port naming was fixed which read from the wrong eeprom location.
 * 1.1.4    21/10/2014   Added websocket client to enable CFSolo remotely configurable.
 *                       CFSolo will first check for the connection flag set in HTTP response after making the announcement,
 *                       then it will attempt to connect to the server via web socket if the flag is 1.
 * 1.1.3    15/10/2014   Enables CFSolo to route data directly via TCP sockets to the on-board serial ports.
 *                       Each serial port would have a static TCP Server Port that it listens on, starting from 10208.
 *                       A maximum of 4 clients should be able to connect simultaneously to each socket.
 *                       Any data received by the serial port will be forwarded out to all TCP Clients connected.
 *                       Data is not transformed in any way, it is routed directly between the TCP socket and the Serial port, bi-directional.
 *                       This function is enabled by setting the <MODE> to "TCP" via CCFXSPC command.
 * 1.1.2    14/10/2014   Added the Query Macro Name List command QCFXMCL.
 *                       Added TCFXHTP command to enable CFSOLO to send custom HTTP GET requests
 *                       to any local or remote HTTP servers,

 *                       exceeds maximum of 1000 bytes. Also enable TCP/UDP/HTTP server
 *                       to report error code.

 *                       2. QCOMNAM - query COM modole port name
 *                       3. CIRXNAM - configure IR module port name
 *                       4. QIRXNAM - query IR module port name

 *                       2. Remove all unwanted data in the UDP transmit buffer when the device hasn't obtain
 *                          a valid IP address.
 * 1.0.8    22/9/2014    1. The dry contact debounce period has been reduced to 100ms to
 *                          ensure any quick pulse below 100ms is read as undesired glitch
 *                          and it will be ignored.
 *                       2. Enable "TCFXSTP" (stop macro) command with no macro name to
 *                          stop all running macros.
