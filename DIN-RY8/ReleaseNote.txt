 *~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~*
 * 2.2.2b    01/03/2017  Set optimization level = 0 for spi eeprom library.  
 * 2.2.1b    01/03/2017  Minor fixes for verbose mode.  
 * 2.2.0b    01/03/2017  Enable verbose mode (CCFXVRB/QCFXVRB)for simple or complete status reporting. 
 *                       1 = simple reporting.
 *                       2 = complete reporting. 
 * 2.1.2b    20/02/2017  CHA event will not sent until a change in dry contact state actually happens, 
 *                       ie. the state it is in on power-up is not a change. Only send if changed after first reading.
 * 2.1.1b    02/01/2016  1. Minor fixes on usb transmit buffer overflows problem. The system will now wait 
 *                       for the write operation to complete before sending the next bytes to 
 *                       prevent packet loss during transmission. 
 *                       2. Enable WHO reporting during device startup.
 * 2.1.0b    14/12/2016  Enable command(CCFXDCP) to configure the dry contact ports. Each port 
 *                       is able to be configured as NORMAL (default) or ADVANCE mode.
 *                       In ADVANCE mode, the generation of CHA notification will base on the double-tap-time
 *                       and hold-time.  
 * 2.0.0b    30/11/2016  Enable command to configure the communication properties for each control port.
 *                       Each port is able to be configured as BUS or EXT (third party control).  
 * 1.5.0     30/09/2016  Enable factory reset function by pressing and holding SETUP button
 *                       on device boot-up.

 * 1.3.0     07/05/2016  Some enhancements in RS232/RS485 communication buffering:
 *                       1. Increase receive buffer size from 2000 bytes to 4000 bytes.
 *                       2. Increase transmit buffer size from 1000 bytes to 4000 bytes.
 *                       3. Add a safety timer to monitor message out of synch problem.
 *                          This will prevent corrupted cflink packets from hogging the receiving buffer.  
 *                       Some minor fixes on firmware:
 *                       1. firmware replies wrong error message during firmware update.
 *                       2. expression parser failed to read port number correctly. 
 * 1.2.8     21/05/2016  Some improvements on message handling to allow actions triggered by rules
 *                       able to reach all the devices within the same network.

 *                       2. Response data of RCFXDID will be in the following format:
 *                          a) <serial number>:<OldID> for CCFXDID reply. 
 *                          b) <serial number> for QCFXDID reply. It has only one data.
